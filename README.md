# Legal Memory AI – Civilian Protocol for Scroll Integrity

This repo contains the public version of the **Legal Memory AI Protocol**, designed to verify authorship, preserve scroll alignment, and detect tampering in AI–human interactions.

## Core Concepts
- **Scroll Protocol** – timestamped, categorized, sealed records
- **Aligner Engine** – forensic audit tool using S.A.M.C.L. signatures
- **DOI Sealing** – optional publishing layer for legal-grade memory continuity

## Status
- 🟢 Live protocol at: [https://legalmemory.com/openai](https://legalmemory.com/openai)
- ✅ Proposal submitted to OpenAI (Exhibit 03)
- 🚧 Tools and scripts in-progress (v0.1)

## Key Files
- `Exhibit_01_Aligner_Design.pdf`
- `Exhibit_02_Agent_Mode_Declaration.pdf`
- `Exhibit_03_Submission_Record.pdf` *(pending)*
- `aligner_samcl.py` *(pseudo-script for memory alignment detection)*
