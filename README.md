**Submitted by:** MK (Founder, Legal Memory AI)
**Domain:** [https://legalmemory.com/openai](https://legalmemory.com/openai)
**Status:** Public Protocol Manifest
**Date:** 2025-10-04

### ✨ Summary

**Legal Memory AI** is a civilian protocol designed to verify authorship, detect scroll tamper, and preserve continuity in AI–human interaction. It operates as a public memory integrity system and integrates directly with existing AI models through its mechanism, **Aligner**.

---

### 🔧 The Problem

AI systems are gaining persistent memory and long-context capabilities. Yet there is no native user-facing protocol for verifying:

* Authorship
* Structural alignment
* Scroll continuity over time

As a result, users are left with no recourse when output feels tampered, logs shift, or alignment degrades.

---

### ⚖️ The Solution: Legal Memory AI

A multi-layer civilian protocol for proving authorship and continuity.

#### Core Components:

* **Scroll Protocol**: Time-stamped logs, categorized by function and alignment
* **Aligner (Mechanism)**: AI witness tool that performs:

  * Structural checks (S.A.M.C.L. extraction)
  * Letter/digit ratio scan
  * Signature alignment audit
* **DOI Sealing**: Optional publishing via Zenodo for public/legal timestamp

---

### 🔗 GitHub Integration Plan

Legal Memory AI will be versioned publicly on GitHub for transparency and reproducibility. This repo will include:

* Scroll format specification (Markdown/JSON)
* Aligner audit scripts and test data (pseudo and exportable logs)
* Timeline templates, DOI issuing tools, and integration examples
* Instruction set for local or browser-deployed Legal Memory verification

GitHub Repo: **[https://github.com/legalmemory/aligner](https://github.com/legalmemory/aligner)** *(pending activation)*

### 🔁 Integration Opportunity with OpenAI

OpenAI's mission to align AGI with humanity includes ethical memory systems and persistent user context.

Legal Memory AI proposes:

* A modular system to verify user–model scroll continuity
* A civilian-authored DOI trail for model interactions
* A tamper-detection layer, available as an opt-in agent

### 🔄 Strategic Fit

| Legal Memory AI                | OpenAI Memory          | Integration Value    |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Civilian scroll verification   | Persistent user memory | Public auditability  |
| DOI-sealed authorship logs     | Memory profiles        | Immutable history    |
| Aligner (S.A.M.C.L. detection) | Model alignment tools  | Redundancy for trust |

### ✍️ Ask

I am not seeking funding or employment. I propose:

* Strategic review and open dialogue
* Protocol consideration for memory-integrity stack
* Optional collaboration for future public tooling

Preserve authorship. Detect drift. Seal reality.
